## Killer Sudoku Calculator
Language: C++
Killer Sudoku is a fun twist on the classic sudoku with a new concept of a “cage” that makes the sum rule more challenging.  
This program takes the sum and size of cages as input and computes the possible combinations that can fit in the cage.  
Further improvement: Allow user to choose which numbers that must be included in or must be excluded from the cage.
